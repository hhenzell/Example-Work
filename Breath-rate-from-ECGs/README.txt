README

This is a Python project aimed at finding the breath rate from ECG recordings. Measuring the breath rate is clinically important, and ECGs are recorded with relatively simple and widely available devices. Therefore they offer the ability to find the breath rate in resource strapped settings.

I have added all the code for this project, however I do not own the datasets it runs on. If you wish to run the code, you will need to follow the instructions to download in the README file in the Code folder, under the section data.
